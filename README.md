# Shortage
- **HTTP 1.0** is not suitable for this game. I can just use "setInterval" in js to poll for refreshing. **Websocket** is a better choice.
- Game logic is not sufficient. I will upgrade it soon.

# Link
- Play online: http://weneu.xyz:8087/index.html (Server will not run anytime)
- I use [@imcuttle](https://github.com/imcuttle/paint_game) html codes. He use node to make the server, but I use purely C for this course.

# Idea
The Linux operating system course of just six weeks is coming to an end. I really learned a lot of knowledge in six weeks. Before this class, I actually used the CentOS server to run one of my products (weNEU WeChat mini program), so I thought I had some understanding of the Linux operating system. But in this class, I discovered that my understanding of Unix/Linux is only a breeze and I have a simple understanding of some application layer knowledge, I don't know about the underlying knowledge.

This class once again wakes me up. In fact, the usual study should go deeper into the underlying knowledge. If you stay at the application level, you will never learn the real knowledge, and you will never have a mental collision with Computer Predecessors. The framework is changing every day, and only by learning the underlying knowledge I can cope with it and become a skilled guy.

Although the course is over, I think I will continue to fall in love with the learning of the operating system and computer theory.
